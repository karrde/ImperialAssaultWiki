title: Habitat
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

<span class="keyword">Habitat</span> is a keyword found on certain [[Deployment Cards]].  During a campaign, when the Imperial player is selecting open groups for a mission, he can choose a Deployment card with the Habitat keyword only if there is at least one tile in that mission's map whose type matches the listed Habitat.

''Note:'' During a skirmish, Habitat has no effect.
