During a campaign, a hero can interact with a crate token to claim the token and draw one Supply card. The card is placed faceup in the heroâ€™s play area and can be used as instructed on the card.

* Most Supply cards are discarded after use.
* Supply cards cannot be traded to different heroes.
* After a mission ends, all Supply cards are shuffled back into the Supply deck, whether they were used or not.
