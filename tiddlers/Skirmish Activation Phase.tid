title: Skirmish Activation Phase
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Activation Phase:'' Players first resolve any abilities that are triggered at the start of a round (for example, from the Skirmish Mission card).

Then, starting with the player that has initiative, the players take turns activating deployment groups and performing actions with the corresponding figures. Once all Deployment cards are exhausted, players proceed to the Status Phase.
