Numerous abilities, mission rules, and other game effects can be triggered at the same time.

* While attacking, mission rules are resolved first, followed by effects from the attacker (including figures friendly to him), then effects from the defender (including figures friendly to him).
* Effects from multiple figures under the control of a single player are resolved in the order of that playerâ€™s choice.
* The decision for a player to resolve an optional effect coincides with the order of resolution. After a player has declined to trigger one or more abilities, he does not have the opportunity to trigger that ability until the next triggering instance.
!! Conflicts in a Campaign

During a campaign, mission rules are resolved first, followed by effects from the Imperial player, then effects from the Rebel players.

* If multiple mission rules would resolve at the same time, the Imperial player decides the order of resolution.
* When Rebel players wish to resolve multiple effects at the same time, they collectively decide the order of resolution.
* If heroes are required to make a decision as a group and cannot come to a consensus, the Imperial player chooses a Rebel player to make the final decision.

!! Conflicts in a Skirmish

During a skirmish, mission rules are resolved first, followed by effects from the player with initiative, then effects from his opponent.

* If multiple mission rules would resolve at the same time, the player with initiative decides the order of resolution.
