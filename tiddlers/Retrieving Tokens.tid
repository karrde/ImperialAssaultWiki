title: Retrieving Tokens
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Some missions allow figures to retrieve specific tokens. A figure adjacent to or in the same space as the token can perform an interact to retrieve the token. Place the token on the figureâ€™s base to mark that the figure is now ''carrying'' that token. The token now moves with the figure.

* A carried token cannot be retrieved by other figures, traded to other figures, or voluntarily dropped.
* If a figure is defeated, any tokens that it is carrying are dropped in its space. This includes when a hero becomes wounded or if he withdraws.
* Mission rules specify the effect and purpose of retrieving tokens.
* At the end of a mission, all carried tokens are returned to the game box.
* Retrieving a token is not claiming a token.
