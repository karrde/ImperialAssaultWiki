title: Building a Skirmish Mission Deck
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

During game setup, the player with initiative shuffles his Skirmish deck and draws one card to determine the mission to be played. A playerâ€™s Skirmish deck consists of ''one copy'' of each Skirmish Mission card he owns. Players cannot customize the cards in their Skirmish decks.
