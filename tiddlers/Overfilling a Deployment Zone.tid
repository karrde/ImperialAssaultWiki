title: Overfilling a Deployment Zone
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

If a player cannot fit all of his figures into his deployment zone, he must fill as many spaces as possible. This may require him to remove some figures and redeploy in a different order.

After filling as many spaces as possible, the player may deploy his remaining figures in the spaces closest to his deployment zone.
