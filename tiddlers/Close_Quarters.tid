title: Close Quarters
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Verena Talos’s “Close Quarters” ability allows her to perform attacks using an opponent’s attack type and attack pool.

* When using this ability, Verena does not gain access to surge abilities on the targeted  gure’s Deployment card, nor does she gain access to that figure’s abilities (such as the Probe Droid’s “Targeting Computer” ability).
* When “Close Quarters” is used in relation to a figure without a specific dice pool, such as a figure with “Arsenal” or “Epic Arsenal,” the dice pool is determined by that figure’s controlling player by the same method as if the figure were attacking. For example, if this occurred in relation to a figure with “Arsenal,” the player controlling the targeted figure determines which two dice Verena will use during “Close Quarters.”
