If a rule in this guide contradicts a rule in the Learn to Play booklet or Skirmish Guide, the rule in this reference guide takes priority.<p>
Card abilities can override the rules listed in this guide. Mission rules can override both card abilities and rules from this guide.<p>
If a card or mission uses the word cannot, that effect is absolute and ''cannot'' be overridden by other effects.<p>
