Some spaces have colored borders. The color and look of a border defines the terrain, which has special effects on movement and line of sight.

* A group of adjacent spaces that share a terrain type are surrounded by a single terrain border.
* Colored borders that do not fully encompass a space or group of spaces are terrain edges. The terrain rules are only applied to the colored edge of this space and not the space itself.
* Tokens in a space have no effect on the spaceâ€™s terrain. 
* Solid red lines are blocking terrain.
* Dotted red lines are impassible terrain. 
* Solid blue lines are difficult terrain.
* Spaces that are fully encompassed by a combination of a single terrain border and walls are considered to be fully encompassed by the terrain border.
