type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Deploy Rebel Figures:'' Rebel players place all Rebel figures in the space containing and as close as possible to the entrance token. This includes the space containing the entrance token.

* Rebel players choose the order in which their figures are deployed. Before placing their figures, they choose the Item cards that they will bring to the mission. Each hero may bring up to 1 Armor ([img[Armor.png]]), 2 Weapons, and 3 Equipment ([img[Equipment.png]]).
* After deploying hero figures, Rebel players may choose to deploy an ally that they have gained as a reward (see “[[Allies]]”).
