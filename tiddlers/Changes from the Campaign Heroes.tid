title: Changes from the Campaign Heroes
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Heroes:'' Hero sheets are not used in skirmishes. Instead, players use the corresponding Deployment cards. These cards have stats and abilities similar to, but not exactly the same as, those used in a campaign.

Because heroes use Deployment cards, they do not follow the hero rules from the campaign and instead function like all other figures. Their activations are tracked by exhausting their Deployment cards, they can use one action to attack per activation, and they are removed from the map when defeated.
