title: Winning a Skirmish Card and Mission Effects
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

''Card and Mission Effects:'' Each Skirmish Mission card lists special ways in which players can gain VPs. In addition, some Command or Deployment cards may list additional ways in which players gain VPs.

When a player gains VPs in any of these ways, he should record the number of VPs and keep it by the figures he has defeated. We recommend using the Threat Dial to track these VPs, though players may wish to use tokens, dice, or a piece of paper.
