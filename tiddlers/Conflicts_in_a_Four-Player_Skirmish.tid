title: Conflicts in a Four-Player Skirmish
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

During a four-player skirmish, mission rules are resolved first, followed by effects from the player with initiative, and then effects from each other player, proceeding clockwise around the table.

Also, when playing a team battle skirmish, conflicts that arise during an attack resolve slightly differently than in other missions. Mission rules are resolved first, followed by effects from the attacker and the attacker’s figures, then effects from the defender and his figures. After both the attacker’s and defender’s effects have resolved, the attacker’s teammate may resolve effects, followed by the defender’s teammate.
