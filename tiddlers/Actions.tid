title: Actions
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

During a figureâ€™s activation, it may perform two actions. The available actions are Attack, Move, Interact, Rest, and Special.<p>

* The figure is not required to perform both actions.
* Each action must be resolved completely before the figure performs its next action.
* Special actions are denoted on components by the [img[Action.png]] icon.  A figure can choose to spend one of its actions to resolve a special action from one of its cards. If an ability has two [img[Action.png]] icons, it costs the figure two of its actions to resolve this ability.
** When a special action contains multiple attacks, or a move and an attack, it still only requires the listed number of actions to perform.
* Movement points can be spent before or after performing an action. If movement points are gained as part of a special action, they must be spent immediately during that action.
* A figure can perform the same action multiple times during the same activation except as follows:
** A non-hero figure can use only one of its actions to perform an attack per activation.
** A figure can perform each special action only once per activation.
* Numerous game effects allow figures to attack, rest, interact, or perform a move without performing an action.
