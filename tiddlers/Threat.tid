During a campaign mission, the Imperial player spends [img[Threat.png]] (threat) to deploy and reinforce figures to the game board.

* Each Status Phase, [img[Threat.png]] is increased by the missionâ€™s threat level printed on the campaign log. Threat level is also frequently referenced to determine a particular value in many missions.
* When [img[Threat.png]] is increased or reduced, the Imperial player rotates the threat dial to display the new total.
* The Imperial player cannot have less than 0 [img[Threat.png]] or more than 20 [img[Threat.png]]. Any threat gained or lost beyond these limits is ignored.
* The Imperial player cannot trigger an ability that costs more [img[Threat.png]] than he has.
