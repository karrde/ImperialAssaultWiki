type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

There are numerous methods by which a figure can gain movement points. A figure can spend one movement point to move to any adjacent space.

* Any time a figure gains movement points, they are added to the remaining total of movement points that figure possesses.
* A figure is not required to spend all of the movement points it possesses, but at the end of its activation, it loses all of its remaining movement points.
* Spending movement points is not an action and may be done at any time during the figureâ€™s activation. They can be spent before or after performing any action but cannot be spent while resolving an action.
* If a figure gains movement points when it is not its activation, those movement points must be spent immediately as an interrupt or be lost.
* Movement points are an intangible resource that are not tracked by tokens. When a figure gains movement points, the player announces how many movement points his figure has and counts out loud as he spends movement points.
* During a campaign, a hero can suffer 1[img[Strain.png]] (strain) at any point during his activation to gain one movement point. He may do this up to ''twice'' per activation.
