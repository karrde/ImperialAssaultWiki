type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

During a campaign, hero figures can perform an action to rest. When performing a rest, the hero recovers [img[Strain.png]] equal to his Endurance.

* If he recovers more [img[Strain.png]] than he has suffered, he recovers one [img[Damage.png]] for each [img[Strain.png]] he cannot recover.
