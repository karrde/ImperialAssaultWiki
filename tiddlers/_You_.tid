type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Many cards use the word "you" to refer to a figure instead of the player.  for example, is a Deployment card reads "While attacking, you may reroll 1 attack die," any figur belonging to that card's group amy reroll one die while it is attacking.

* If an effect corresponding to a figure instructs "you" to claim a token, gain VPs, or manipulate cards, or refers to "your" army or figures, "you" referes to that figure's player.
