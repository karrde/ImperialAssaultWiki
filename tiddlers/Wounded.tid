title: Wounded
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

During a campaign, when a healthy hero suffers [img[Damage.png]] (damage) equal to his Health he is wounded. He discards all damage tokens and flips his Hero sheet to the wounded side. If his [img[Strain.png]] (strain) exceeds his new Endurance value, he discards any strain tokens that exceed his Endurance.

* If a wounded hero is defeated, he withdraws.
* The wounded side of a hero sheet lists fewer abilities and often has lower Health, Speed, Endurance, or Attributes.
* Once a hero is wounded, his sheet remains on the wounded side until the end of the mission.
* If a card or mission effect allows a wounded hero to flip his hero sheet to the healthy side during the course of a mission, that hero is no longer wounded.
