The Massive keyword is found on some Deployment cards and refers to a series of special rules that apply to figures in that group.

* Figures do not block line of sight ''to or from'' a Massive figure. 
* During a campaign, Massive figures cannot enter interior spaces.
* Massive figures can enter spaces containing blocking terrain and impassible terrain. They can also move through and end their movement on blocked or impassible edges.
* Massive figures can enter spaces containing hostile figures and/or difficult terrain at no additional movement cost.
* Massive figures cannot enter spaces containing other Massive figures.
* A Massive figure can end its movement in spaces that contain blocking terrain and/or other figures. Any figures in its spaces are pushed into the closest empty space of its controllerâ€™s choice (taking impassible terrain into account). The player moving the Massive figure pushes friendly figures first, and then other players push their figures.
* After a Massive figure ends its movement in spaces containing at least one other figure, the Massive figure cannot move any more during this activation.
