title: Escaping
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Certain mission rules can allow a figure to escape. In order to escape, the figure must spend one movement point while in or adjacent to the space indicated in the missionâ€™s rules.

After a figure escapes, remove that figure from the map. That figure cannot be affected by abilities, and cannot perform activations.
