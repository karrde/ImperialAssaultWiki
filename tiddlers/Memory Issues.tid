Some Command cards have abilities that apply until a specific time, such as the end of the game round. To help remember that the card is in effect, players may wish to place the card by the component it is affecting. For example, if a Command card gives a figure a bonus each time it defends this round, players may wish to keep the card by the figure or its Deployment card until the end of the round.
