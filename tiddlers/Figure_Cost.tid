title: Figure Cost
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Each figure in //Imperial Assault// has a figure cost that may be referenced by abilities and game effects.  A figure cost is one of two values:

* If a deployment group has a starting group size of 1, that figure's cost is equal to the group's deployment cost.
* If a deployment group has a starting group size of 2 or more, each figure in that group has a figure cost equal to the group's reinforcement cost.
