Each player can only use one copy of each unique card at a time. These cards are identified by a bullet (•) before the name, for example, “• Darth Vader.”

* Unique cards are identified by name only. Sub-names, affiliations, and abilities are not taken into account when determining which cards have the same name. For example, a player that has “• Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith” cannot deploy any other version of Darth Vader.
