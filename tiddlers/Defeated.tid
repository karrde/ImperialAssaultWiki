type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When a figure has a number of damage tokens equal to its Health, the figure is defeated.

* When a hero is defeated for the first time during a mission, he is wounded and flips his Hero sheet to the wounded side. If a wounded hero is defeated, he withdraws and is removed from the map.
** When any other figure is defeated, it is removed from the map along with any of its condition and damage tokens.
* If a figure is defeated during its activation, its activation immediately ends.
* During a campaign, when the last Imperial figure in a ''non- unique'' group is defeated, the Deployment card is returned to the Imperial playerâ€™s hand and can be optionally deployed later in the mission.
