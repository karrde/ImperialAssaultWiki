title: Strain in a Skirmish
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When a figure suffers [img[Strain.png]], it suffers an equal amount of [img[Damage.png]] (damage) instead. The player controlling the figure can prevent any of this [img[Damage.png]] by discarding one Command card from the top of his deck for each [img[Strain.png]] that he wishes to prevent.
